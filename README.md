# COMP2931 Software Project

## To Do

1.  [Set up an SSH key pair](https://gitlab.com/help/ssh/README.md) for
    your GitLab account, if you haven't already done so.

2.  Clone this project to your SoC filestore / own PC (replace `team` in
    the command below with your team's name, in lowercase):

        git clone git@gitlab.com:comp2931/team.git

3.  [Learn the Markdown syntax](https://gitlab.com/help/user/markdown.md)
    needed to edit this README and your project's wiki pages.

4.  Customise this README, replacing its contents with your team name
    and a list of team member names, plus any other essential 'front-page'
    information that you deem useful for the project.

5.  Edit your project avatar; use an image appropriate to your team name!

6.  Decide on your project workflow.  By default, feature branch workflow
    is assumed - meaning that at least one team member (preferably two) is
    expected to take responsibility for handling merge requests from
    other team members; alternatively, you may wish to risk allowing all
    team members to push to the master branch.  Either way, inform Nick
    of your preference via email.
