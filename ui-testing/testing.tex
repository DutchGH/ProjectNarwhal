\section{Introduction}
In this document we present a number of real-world tests.
That is, tests that mimic the behaviour that is performed by a typical user in a browser setting.

\section{Sign-in}
\screen{0.8}{sign-in-form}{A screenshot of the sign-in form.}
We expect that on entry of correct login details we are able to successfully login, while incorrect login details results in a message telling us that something is wrong.
As expected, we receive an error message in the top-right corner when entering incorrect login details:
\screen{0.8}{sign-in-fail}{Unsuccessful sign-in attempt.}
