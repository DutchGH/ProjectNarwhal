##SMS python scripts using twilio SMS gateway service

Currently using a trial account which can be upgraded by buying SMS messages for under Â£0.01.

Running the send_sms.py script returns the messages SID in the terminal as well as sending a message to the given number.

textmyself.py allows you to send a text to a number once an event has occured, in our case this will be once a room booking has been confirmed. This is done by placing the function in another .py file.
