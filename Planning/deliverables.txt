Deliverables:
  -Git Repo:
    -Everyone needs to contribute, this will be checked.
    -Commit messages need to be descriptive.
    -Make sure we use tagging when appropriate, like at the end of each sprint
     or when a version is completed.
    -Distribution of commits over time will be marked so keep things regular.
  -Issue Tracker:
    -Someone needs to look at the proper way of doing this.
    -Used on Gitlab, need to agree on a format.
    -Someone needs to be allocated to this, we will be marked.
  -Wiki:
    -Basic team info.
    -Notes from meeting.
    -Design documents:
      -User stories?
      -Use case diagrams?
      -Umls?
    -User interface mock-ups.
    -Coding style and team protocol.
    -Testing progress, test plans and outcomes.
    -User manual for finished project:
      -There are ways of generating documentation with things like Ant, maybe
       worth looking into?
      -Needs a written explanation of how to use the product with screenshots.
    -Anything else that is relevant.
  -Software itself:
    -Standardized coding / commenting style
    -They will look for semantic design:
      -Data modelling.
      -Architecture of solution.
      -Evolution of user interface.
    -Maybe standardize dev tools? (maybe not)
    -Good project automation and thorough testing will be marked well.
    -This is going to be submitted as a Zip archive containing everything needed
     to build and run software. Should not have the ".git" directory.
      -Extra marks for a "Demo-mode" that is "Suitably foolproof", possibly using
       a specifically built database.
  -Individual reflective reports:
    -2-3 pages of A4, submitted as PDF to Turnitin.
    -Reflection of successes and failures.
    -Will be detailed further at a later date. (Please update)
    -Honest assessment of own contribution, this will be checked on Gitlab.

Mark allocation:
  -Group component worth 80 marks:
    -Usually the same for all unless team agrees that someone didn't contribute.
    -This will also be checked automatically on Gitlab, with or without group
     action.
  -Individual report worth 20 marks.
