Things to bring up tomorrow:

-In the first sprint we intend to implement the database model and create some
queries for the front end to use.
-We won't have a huge amount of time  however so we need to prioritize which queries
we will make. Ask the front end team what functionality they want from the first
sprint and prioritize these queries.
-We intend to use Flask-Security to control session authentication and encrypt
passwords.
-We also intend to use flask-mail to send emails for account authorization and
session reminders etc.
-Since flask security only controls use through login, it will not cover users
creating accounts, as such the user will be sent an authorization email after
creating an account and will be directed back into the login screen. This way they
will only be able to modify database entries after they log in properly.
-We need to know what forms we need to make to match the functionality required
by the front-end.
-Ask Si about the python to sms thing.
