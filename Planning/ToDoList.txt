TODO BY 10/12/2017

DESIGN:
  - Check Activity Diagrams
    - Transition into wireframes from that 

BACK END (Ben and Luke)
  - Prioritise queries for first sprint w/ front end team
  - Confirm apprpriate flask modules (Security and Mail)
    - Make sure email confirmation technique is viable
  - Check what forms need to be generated 

FRONT END (Horsfield & Si)
  - Si: SMS Feature walkthrough
  - Agree on variable names for seamless form integration (Should be done via UML)

BOTH TEAMS
  - Confirm Activity Diagrams
    - Make Wireframs from these
    - As discussed earlier, making a UML diagram would be good before the sprint so intgration into master is less error prone...
    - Agree on what user stories should be implemented for the sprint
      - Create Trello Accounts to implement these stories
    - Prioritise queries and forms needed for the first sprint

SCRUM MASTER
  - Look at backlog 
    - Generate user Stories
  - Prioritise User Stories with Team + Generate Estimates 
    - Create a Sprint Backlog with the necessary assignments
    //Make sure this creates a 'shippable increment - i.e user generation and modification'
  - Confirm schedules with team and create status meetings
  - Agree on a better way to write a todo list - Office 365 might be viable, or have a private wiki page instead...
